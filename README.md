**AI-Driven Class Monitoring System with 3D NeRF Modeling**  This system combines AI, ML, and computer vision with 3D Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to monitor classrooms in real-time. It automates attendance via facial recognition, tracks student engagement through behavior analysis, and provides 3D spatial visualization of classroom dynamics.
